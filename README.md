# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create two tables: one to determine the number of retiring employees and their position titles, and the other to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Within the first table, we included information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date. In the second, we added employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title.

## Results
